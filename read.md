This project was created in Fall 2015 for a client side web development class. This site uses HTML and CSS  to showcase a fictional Chicago football team and its players. Some javascript is used as well to create a carousel effect with images and also an alert message in the contact page. 

Actual site can be viewed here : http://homepages.neiu.edu/~jcnava4/cs300projectII/punks.html
