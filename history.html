<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">History of the Chicago Punks</h1>
<p>The Chicago Punks was founded by Charles Grimes. He realized that Chicago was losing its credibility in the football industry and many 
other sports were also failing to make Chicago the best city in the world. The 2006-2007 season would be the debut of the Punks and they 
had many doubters. The roster was filled with rookies and a coach who had no idea what he was doing. The first season saw a horrible 
record of 3-13 happen. The owner, Mr. Grimes, nearly gave up on this new team but decided a second year could benefit the team and 
possibly lead them to a championship. </p>


<p>The 2007-2008 season saw much improvement as the team went 8-8 in the season. Although they didn’t make it to the finals, the team’s 
ego would begin to boost. A motto was born that year and it was, “We like to win, so we always do!” The team’s all-star, Daryl Matthews, 
would have motivational talks with the team and scored most of the touch downs. He was one of the only men to never get injured or ever 
have any facial scars. The ladies loved him so he began to call himself “Prince Pretty.” Daryl Matthews realized that winning not only 
would get him more money but the ladies as well. So his strategy going into the next season was to get all the players extra motivated 
by letting them know that fame and fortune awaited. “Chicago needs a winning team and it is about damn time we give them one who are 
ruthless but also look good doing it”, said Daryl.</p>


<p>The years 2008-2014 saw the Punks dominate the EFL. They bulldozed through teams such as the Detroit Cats, Memphis Rockers, and 
Cleveland Sockets. For two consecutive years the Punks would meet the Milwaukee Maniacs in the Super Bowl. Daryl Matthews’s motivational 
speeches and promise to fame led the team to defeat the Maniacs with over a twenty point lead. Year after year the Punks were ranking up 
wins and also money in their bank accounts. The main star Daryl Matthews would be on covers of magazines and even starred in the movie 
“The Mighty League” as he played the main character Dr. Invincible.</p>


<p>After owning the EFL, Daryl Matthews decided to retire as an active football player. The Chicago Punks lost its best player and would 
end up 10-6 in the 2014-2015 season. The fans at this point didn’t care as they still showed up to the games with signs and waved Chicago 
flags all over Punks Field. The 2015-2016 is now under way and the hunger for victory continues. The team knows that Chicago pretty much 
is on their backs as the city continues to dominate the rest. Owner Charles Grimes believes that the Punks will rise to the occasion and 
win, like usual, again. The major is in the process of creating a city holiday known as “Punks Appreciation Day” where all businesses 
will close and honor these heroes. A huge celebration is scheduled to be held in Soilder Field and all the proceeds made that day will 
go towards the team players to pay their salaries and buy new leather gear.  </p>
